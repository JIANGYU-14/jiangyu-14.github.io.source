            <div style="text-align: justify;">Team members from <a href="https://www.antgroup.com/en">Ant Group</a>, In 2015, Ant formally established a technical risk department to consolidate its disaster recovery capabilities and build a capital security prevention and control system. In 2016, the department set up the first SRE team in China, and began to comprehensively carry out work such as automatic fault location, adaptive disaster recovery, gray-scale environment construction, financial security immunity, and refined high availability. Up to now, the Technical Risk Department has achieved milestones such as Yuntong Future, the construction of five centers in three places for disaster recovery. Currently, the department is moving towards building a digital management system that drives continuous improvement in risk control, operation efficiency and cost optimization.</div><br>

          <div style="text-align: justify;">Monitoring refers to instrumenting an app to collect, aggregate, and analyze logs and metrics to improve our understanding of its behavior. While logs describe specific events, metrics are a measurement of a system at a given point in time â€” they are two different things but both necessary to get the full picture of your system's health. Monitoring includes everything from watching disk space, CPU usage, and memory consumption on individual nodes to doing detailed synthetic transactions to see if a system or application is responding correctly and in a timely manner. There are a number of different approaches to monitor systems and applications.</div>
